# DiabetesPredictor

I've created this model as a way to introduce myself to some common Machine Learning algorithms. This model uses Pima Indian data to predict whether a person is likely to develop diabetes with a 70%+ accuracy. While I experimented with a few ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, Linear Regession), the final model uses Logistic Regression.
